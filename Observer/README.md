# Observer Design Pattern

The Observer design pattern is a behavioral pattern that facilitates the implementation of distributed event handling systems. It establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects, where one object (the subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them of state changes, ensuring loose coupling between subjects and observers.

## Why Use Observer?

- **Decoupling**: Observer pattern promotes decoupling between subjects and observers. Subjects don't need to know specific details about their observers, and observers are unaware of the number and nature of other observers.

- **Extensibility**: It allows for easy addition of new observers without modifying existing code, making the system more extensible.

- **Flexibility**: Subjects can notify observers about state changes, enabling dynamic behavior based on changes in the subject's state.

- **Reusability**: Observers can be reused across different subjects, promoting code reuse.

## When to Use Observer?

- Use the Observer pattern when you have a one-to-many dependency between objects, where changes in one object need to be propagated to multiple dependent objects.

- Use it when you want to achieve loose coupling between subjects and observers, allowing for more flexibility in your system's design.

- Choose this pattern when you need to implement distributed event handling or notification systems.

## Real-World Examples

1. **Stock Market Applications**: Stock trading systems often use the Observer pattern. Multiple investors (observers) subscribe to changes in stock prices (subject). When the stock price changes, all investors are notified.

2. **Social Media Notifications**: Social media platforms employ the Observer pattern to send notifications to users. Users subscribe to specific events (e.g., likes, comments), and when these events occur, notifications are sent to all interested users.

3. **Weather Forecasting**: Weather monitoring systems utilize the Observer pattern. Weather stations (subjects) monitor weather conditions and notify various weather apps and websites (observers) when weather data changes.

4. **Traffic Management**: Traffic management systems can apply the Observer pattern. Traffic signals (subjects) notify nearby vehicles (observers) of changes in signal status to control traffic flow efficiently.

## Code Description

The provided Go code example demonstrates the Observer design pattern in the context of a simple notification service. It consists of three main components:

- `ISubscriber`: An interface that defines methods `notify()` and `getID()` for subscribers (observers). Subscribers implement this interface to receive notifications.

- `Product`: Represents the subject that observers subscribe to. It maintains a list of subscribers and provides methods for subscription, unsubscription, and notification.

- `Costumer` and `Company`: Concrete observer classes that implement the `ISubscriber` interface. They subscribe to the `Product` and receive notifications when the product becomes available.

This code illustrates how the Observer pattern allows multiple subscribers (customers and companies) to receive notifications when a product becomes available. The pattern enhances maintainability and flexibility, as new subscribers can be added without modifying the existing code.
