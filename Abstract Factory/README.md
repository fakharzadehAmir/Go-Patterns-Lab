# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

The Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows you to create instances of multiple related classes without exposing their underlying implementations. This pattern promotes loose coupling between client code and the concrete classes being used.

**Why Use Abstract Factory**:
- **Abstraction and Encapsulation**: It abstracts the process of object creation and encapsulates it within the factory classes, making the creation process more flexible and maintainable.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that the created objects are compatible and belong to the same family or product group.
- **Dependency Management**: Helps manage dependencies between different components by providing a unified way to create related objects.
- **Configurability**: Allows you to switch between different families of objects by changing the concrete factory implementation, making it suitable for scenarios where you need to support multiple variations of a system.

**Real Examples of Abstract Factory**:

1. **Database Connectivity**:
    - In database libraries, the abstract factory can create database-specific connections, commands, and data readers. For example, a SQL Database Factory might create SQL Server connections, commands, and readers, while an Oracle Database Factory might create Oracle-specific instances.

2. **GUI Toolkits**:
    - GUI libraries like Swing (Java) and Qt (C++) use abstract factories to create platform-specific GUI components. For example, a button created in a Windows GUI factory will have a different implementation than one created in a macOS factory.

3. **Operating System Development**:
    - Operating systems often employ abstract factories to create system-specific processes, threads, and resources. Different operating systems require different implementations for these components.

## Implementation

In this Go package, we've implemented the Abstract Factory design pattern to create sports teams, including soccer, basketball, and volleyball teams, for both men and women. Here's an overview of the key components:

- **Team Interfaces**: We've defined three interfaces: `ISoccerTeam`, `IBasketballTeam`, and `IVolleyballTeam`. These interfaces specify the methods for retrieving specific statistics related to each type of team.

- **Concrete Team Types**: We have six concrete team types: `ManSoccerTeam`, `WomanSoccerTeam`, `ManBasketballTeam`, `WomanBasketballTeam`, `ManVolleyballTeam`, and `WomanVolleyballTeam`. Each type represents a specific team with attributes and methods to retrieve statistics.

- **Team Factories**: To create instances of teams, we've introduced two factories: `ManFactory` and `WomanFactory`. Each factory implements the `ITeamFactory` interface, which defines factory methods for creating soccer, basketball, and volleyball teams for both men and women.

## Usage

To use the Abstract Factory pattern:

1. **Select Factory**: Choose the appropriate factory based on your requirements. In this code, you can use either `ManFactory` or `WomanFactory` depending on whether you want to create men's or women's teams.

2. **Create Teams**: Use the factory methods provided by the selected factory to create instances of soccer, basketball, and volleyball teams. Pass the necessary statistics as parameters to these methods.

3. **Access Team Data**: You can then access team statistics using the methods defined in the respective team interfaces (`ISoccerTeam`, `IBasketballTeam`, and `IVolleyballTeam`).

## Diagram

Here's a simplified UML diagram illustrating the structure of the Abstract Factory pattern in this code:

This diagram shows the relationships between the `ITeamFactory`, concrete factories (`ManFactory`, `WomanFactory`), and the concrete team types (`ManSoccerTeam`, `WomanSoccerTeam`, etc.).
