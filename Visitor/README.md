# Visitor Design Pattern

The Visitor design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. It enables you to add new operations to existing classes without modifying those classes, promoting the open/closed principle. This pattern is particularly useful when you have a stable set of classes but frequently need to add new operations to them.

## Why Use Visitor?

- **Separation of Concerns**: The Visitor pattern separates algorithms or operations from the objects they work on, making it easier to manage and maintain code.

- **Extensibility**: You can add new operations (visitors) to existing classes (elements) without modifying those classes.

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each visitor class is responsible for a single operation, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

## When to Use Visitor?

- Use Visitor when you want to add new operations to existing classes without modifying those classes.

- Use Visitor when you have a set of stable classes but frequently need to extend their functionality.

- Use Visitor when you want to maintain clean and modular code with a separation of concerns.

## Real-World Examples

1. **Compiler Design**: Compilers often use the Visitor pattern to traverse and manipulate abstract syntax trees (ASTs) for various programming languages.

2. **Document Object Models (DOM)**: When working with DOM trees in web development, the Visitor pattern can be employed to perform operations like parsing, traversal, or modification.

3. **Optimization Algorithms**: In optimization algorithms, such as those used in linear programming, visitors can be applied to explore and manipulate constraints and objectives.

4. **UI Frameworks**: User interface frameworks often utilize the Visitor pattern to process and render complex UI components.

## Implementation

In the provided Go code example, we implement the Visitor design pattern to calculate insurance costs for different companies. The `InsuranceVisitor` represents a concrete visitor that performs the calculation. Various concrete elements (`NationalBank`, `ChocolateFactory`, `AppleInc`) accept the visitor and allow it to perform operations specific to each element.

## Code Description

- The `ICompany` interface declares the `accept` method that allows visitors to visit and operate on concrete elements.

- Three concrete element classes (`NationalBank`, `ChocolateFactory`, `AppleInc`) implement the `ICompany` interface, enabling visitors to perform operations on these elements.

- The `Visitor` interface declares methods (`visitBank`, `visitChocolateFactory`, `visitApple`) for each specific operation a visitor can perform on concrete elements.

- The `InsuranceVisitor` is a concrete visitor that calculates insurance costs for different companies based on their founding year.

This code demonstrates how to implement the Visitor pattern to extend the functionality of existing classes without modifying them, providing a clean separation of concerns.
